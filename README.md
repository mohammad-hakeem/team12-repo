# Team-12 web1 final project.
## important note
we changed the the original design that was sent by eng.Samer to maintain compatibility and connectivity, since he sent us 2 pictures one for the latest blogs page
and one for the expand blog page, we decided to make the first blog in the latest blogs page clickable not just for styling as the rest of the components that we were
asked to do, so when you click the first blog it will take you to the expanded blog page.

## the functioning components in the project
1) the latest blogs logo (it will refreash the page)
2) the first blog (it will expand)
3) the navigation buttons between the latest blogs pages
4) the reply/comment button so you can leave a reply
5) obviously the "leave a reply" section
